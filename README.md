Creating a C++ library that analyzes a C++ program for potential errors and highlights them. This library can be thought of as a static code analysis tool. Hereâ€™s a basic outline to get you started:
This is just the initial phase for my project I would be implementing a lot in future. Currently working on Key feature pt 1 and pt2.

### Key Features

1. *Syntax Checking*: Parse the source code to check for syntax errors.
2. *Semantic Analysis*: Ensure the code makes sense in the context of C++ semantics.
3. *Common Error Detection*:
   - Memory leaks.
   - Null pointer dereferencing.
   - Uninitialized variables.
   - Unreachable code.
   - Type mismatches.
   - Buffer overflows.
4. *Code Highlighting*: Highlight the part of the code where the error occurs.
